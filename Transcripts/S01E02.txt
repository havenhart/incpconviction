00;00;00;03 - 00;00;34;23
Channel Master Nick
So as you head out, the plains are fairly quiet. The weather is rather nice just a soft breeze. Not too hot. It's a midsummer day. The grasses are a mixture of lush greens and patches of more drier grass that crunch under the hooves of your horse. After probably. Let's see to scale here. An hour or so after the buildings and surrounding

00;00;35;15 - 00;00;58;18
Channel Master Nick
Signs of settlement from Olfden disappear behind you. And you're out in the open plains. You can actually hear in the distance the howling of wolves. Other than that, it's a nice, serene day, but a little unnerving with the howls of the wolves, off in the distance.

00;00;59;04 - 00;01;03;04
Mellie
Close enough that we would need to be concerned?

00;01;03;08 - 00;01;23;00
Channel Master Nick
Not really. Extremely close. It's just with this being an open plain, the sound travels quite a long distance. And as you continue to travel, not much else happens. It's pretty easy going, really. Probably about midday. You've cleared a good distance of your travel.

00;01;24;03 - 00;01;45;03
Mellie
As we're traveling, I am very curiously asking the three of you, you know, everything about what you've been doing since we've been gone. I'm trying to vaguely brushing off any questions that might be directed at me. I mean, I answer, but I'm not. It's just really kind of vague, non-committal. I don't want to talk about that in a way.

00;01;45;06 - 00;02;15;01
Damos
Well, Demos would, of course, chime in that he traveled the land. He ventured around really to some little to less named settlements and just really entombed himself with nature and the surrounding. He really came to understand more about the world itself and enter it like, you know, his his inner self as well. But he still is this traveling to find, you know, enlightenment.

00;02;15;07 - 00;02;26;05
Damos
You know, that's that's the enjoyment of journeys. And these these uh trips. But being around you three, again, has really brought out the best in him.

00;02;26;06 - 00;02;29;01
Mellie
That's beautiful. That sounds like a beautiful way to live.

00;02;29;16 - 00;02;40;10
Thurin
Pretty much any question about me gets the same exact answer about. Well, you know, I learned about, you know, God and stuff. Lots of religious things, learning how to be.

00;02;40;16 - 00;02;41;17
Mellie
A lot of religious stuff.

00;02;41;21 - 00;02;46;14
Thurin
Learning how to be really learning how to be really pious, yeah that’s it.

00;02;46;14 - 00;03;02;21
Geldr
so, so thorough. And how does I've been meaning to clean up my act and live my life more in accordance with, you know, with with with the teachings of the gods. And I'd like to know firsthand from your extensive experience. How exactly does one do that?

00;03;02;21 - 00;03;09;12
Thurin
Well, you know, it has to start off. You have to open up your heart to the God stuff, religion such.

00;03;09;12 - 00;03;20;09
Geldr
Well, which one? Which who do you follow? Your if your your your cleric of perhaps some renown at this point? I mean, come on, man, spill the beans.

00;03;20;18 - 00;03;21;20
Damos
He’s not holding any beans.

00;03;21;21 - 00;03;23;05
Thurin
Well, you know, I mean, just just

00;03;23;05 - 00;03;26;27
Geldr
He’s holding holy beans, and I want to know what they look like.

00;03;26;27 - 00;03;40;29
Thurin
You know, I follow. I follow Gozreh And, you know, he's he's he's a really, really cool god, You know, he he governs over nature and the sea and weather and animals and such. You know.

00;03;40;29 - 00;03;41;29
Mellie
This. Is deep.

00;03;41;29 - 00;03;56;22
Thurin
Very, very similar to, you know, what's what the monks do. But, you know, if the monks do the God thing, it would also be Gozreh. If they're really, really felt about that that spoke to my inner self.

00;03;57;06 - 00;03;59;09
Damos
I still don’t understanding, he’s not holding any beans to spill.

00;03;59;25 - 00;04;03;18
Damos
Oh, oh

00;04;03;18 - 00;04;03;29
Thurin
you know.

00;04;04;15 - 00;04;06;15
Damos
Oh slang for like knowledge, oh.

00;04;06;18 - 00;04;08;06
Geldr
I think you might be on to something.

00;04;08;06 - 00;04;10;19
Damos
oh

00;04;10;19 - 00;04;15;02
Geldr
You might be on to something with him not holding any beads.

00;04;15;02 - 00;05;03;19
Channel Master Nick
Everyone go ahead and make me Notice rolls. Alright, so let's see here. So with these results Thurin you're too busy trying to come up with a convincing explanation of theology to really pay much attention to anything else around you. Of the others, well, Geldr, you can see up in the distance ahead of you. Kind of a dark cloud hovering in the sky. It's a little bit lower than the other clouds though. And Mellie and Deimos, you actually see that there is a huge swirl of crews up in the distance circling around.

00;05;04;24 - 00;05;11;27
Mellie
Yeah, what’s that, because you’re nature guys? So I'm looking at you now and going what does that mean? This doesn't look good.

00;05;12;19 - 00;05;25;13
Damos
Oh, that ain't good. Oh, generally with a circle of crows good. Indicate, you know, corpse, but with that amount of them has to either be several or a large one.

00;05;26;05 - 00;05;29;13
Channel Master Nick
If I remember correctly, Mellie has Survival.

00;05;29;13 - 00;05;29;29
Mellie
Yes.

00;05;29;29 - 00;05;31;16
Channel Master Nick
Does anyone else have Survival?

00;05;33;28 - 00;05;34;16
Geldr
Nope.

00;05;34;16 - 00;05;35;03
Damos
Nope.

00;05;35;03 - 00;05;41;19
Thurin
I'm just. I'm just still riding and talking and staring at my globe and not even paying attention.

00;05;41;19 - 00;05;45;14
Channel Master Nick
So if you want to give a survival role, you can gain some more insight.

00;05;46;01 - 00;05;50;19
Mellie
Yeah. Oh, I’m exploding! Eleven.

00;05;50;25 - 00;05;54;28
Channel Master Nick
All right, so you are definitely sure that something is dead up ahead?

00;05;55;26 - 00;06;04;11
Mellie
Yeah, now that you say that about dead bodies, that's exactly what that is. It's probably something big or more than one thing. Is this in our path where we're going?

00;06;04;25 - 00;06;05;09
Channel Master Nick
It is.

00;06;06;02 - 00;06;10;13
Mellie
Okay so maybe we should be.

00;06;10;23 - 00;06;12;17
Damos
We can also take a detour.

00;06;13;27 - 00;06;14;16
Mellie
Go, or not. You know.

00;06;14;16 - 00;06;21;14
Thurin
Have I even noticed that they're talking about crows and dead bodies and such.

00;06;21;14 - 00;06;22;14
Channel Master Nick
Let's see.

00;06;22;14 - 00;06;24;29
Thurin
Or am I still just jabbering away to nobody?

00;06;24;29 - 00;06;38;04
Channel Master Nick
I'm going to leave that up to you. Are you the type that would get so absorbed in trying to explain things that you wouldn't pay attention anyone else, or would you eventually figure out people are talking about another subject?

00;06;38;13 - 00;06;51;11
Thurin
Yeah, I feel like I would get so involved in my story that I kind of go blind to the rest of the world and I'm just going along in my story. Blah blah blah God. Blah blah blah pious stuff. Blah Blah Blah God.

00;06;52;07 - 00;06;54;08
Damos
He’s just talking more about those beans he needs to have.

00;06;54;08 - 00;06;56;27
Mellie
You know we have to talk about the beans, I can't forget to talk about the beans.

00;06;57;26 - 00;07;11;26
Thurin
Yes, I'm just I'm just talking that way. And I'm I keep on turning the globe around in my hand while I'm talking. And the horse is just doing the directing. As a matter of fact, can my horse roll a Notice roll to even know that my horse knows to follow everyone else.

00;07;11;26 - 00;07;16;09
Channel Master Nick
Now it's smart enough to know to follow the rest of the group.

00;07;16;21 - 00;07;17;13
Thurin
Okay.

00;07;17;13 - 00;07;21;06
Channel Master Nick
Yes, I would say yeah. They've been trained to travel together.

00;07;21;06 - 00;07;25;29
Geldr
Go where the wind blows?

00;07;26;06 - 00;07;36;17
Mellie
I'm fine fighting, but I'm also good if you wanted to just fall back or flee. How far out do we think this is? Like how far we away from of where the crows are?

00;07;38;21 - 00;07;40;19
Channel Master Nick
Roughly three miles or so.

00;07;41;09 - 00;08;00;17
Damos
Thurin, Thurin, if I may, one, I do not understand where the beans come from, but two, there's a swarm of crows up ahead. You know, generally if there's a corpse or in this case, a large corpse or several number of corpses, you know, in our path.

00;08;01;10 - 00;08;09;21
Thurin
I kind of shake my head and I look at you and I look at where you're pointing. I'm like, Oh, oh, my. Well, why didn't you tell me.

00;08;10;03 - 00;08;21;14
Damos
I didn’t want to interrupt. You were telling me where the beans were coming from, but I'm thinking we may want to take a detour. You know, be cautious about the approach.

00;08;21;15 - 00;08;23;10
Thurin
Maybe someone need some help up there.

00;08;23;10 - 00;08;24;00
Damos
Oh.

00;08;24;00 - 00;08;26;23
Geldr
I mean, you're a cleric. You might be able to heal their wounds.

00;08;26;23 - 00;08;31;21
Thurin
Exactly.

00;08;31;21 - 00;08;32;03
Damos
Well.

00;08;32;03 - 00;08;36;00
Mellie
Oh, okay. Well, now we have to go.

00;08;36;01 - 00;08;52;26
Thurin
I hold my Gozreh’s Globe close to my heart, and I say, I'm going to ask Gozreh for guidance. Guidance. And I and I close my eyes, I close my eyes that Gozreh is telling me that someone needs help ahead.

00;08;53;08 - 00;08;57;13
Mellie
We should be quiet, a cleric at his level, you know, let’s not interrupt this.

00;08;57;13 - 00;08;58;06
Damos
Is that his bean?

00;08;58;22 - 00;09;02;11
Mellie
Is Gozreh a bean? Is that a giant bean? Is it full of beans do you think?

00;09;02;22 - 00;09;06;08
Damos
No, no, no. The thing he’s holding. Oh, interesting.

00;09;06;08 - 00;09;10;16
Geldr
Meanwhile, a butterfly lands on my shoulder and I'm like, Yeah, yeah, shut up. I'm going.

00;09;10;16 - 00;09;13;06
Damos
Who is he talking to?

00;09;13;06 - 00;09;15;03
Mellie
I think that he got a message that.

00;09;15;16 - 00;09;16;10
Damos
Oh, okay.

00;09;16;27 - 00;09;27;00
Mellie
You know what? I just assume that like all the people that say that they’re engaged with a god or anything like that I'm just like one hundred percent. Yes, I believe it. It doesn't ever happen to me. I am full in.

00;09;28;01 - 00;09;31;04
Channel Master Nick
All right. So what's your consensus on the situation?

00;09;31;15 - 00;09;33;20
Mellie
I mean, I think we have to go.

00;09;33;20 - 00;09;42;02
Damos
I think we're going. We're going, but cautiously.

00;09;42;02 - 00;09;43;26
Geldr
Same, just just going.

00;09;43;26 - 00;10;16;05
Channel Master Nick
All right. So you travel a little while longer and you get to the top of a little rise and you can actually see now that there are several large boars that have been killed and slaughtered on the plains. Several large rocks are scattered about as well. And you can see this mass of crows circling around. Some are pecking at what remains of the boars. The others are flying overhead.

00;10;17;23 - 00;10;28;13
Mellie
Can I tell what might have done this? Meaning I have seen some death, especially weapon death, you know, death from weapons. like can I tell possibly what did this?

00;10;28;13 - 00;10;29;28
Thurin
Rocks fell, every boar died.

00;10;30;22 - 00;10;34;29
Damos
I think after that I would just probably try to take in the surroundings, see if I see anything else off.

00;10;35;04 - 00;10;44;17
Channel Master Nick
And from your vantage point, you can't really tell. Okay. Especially with the the extra damage that the crows have done.

00;10;45;00 - 00;10;51;02
Damos
Well, I still think it's safe to try to go around.

00;10;51;02 - 00;10;54;25
Mellie
Yeah. Now that we know nobody needs help that we're aware of, I'm okay with that too.

00;10;54;27 - 00;11;05;14
Channel Master Nick
Okay and this is basically what you're seeing with the circle indicating the swarm. All right. So you're deciding to go around.

00;11;05;14 - 00;11;16;24
Thurin
I'm I'm convinced that there is someone in need of help. I am completely convinced of that. And I am adamant that I'm going to go and see if there's someone that needs help.

00;11;16;24 - 00;11;17;28
Geldr
I’m tagging along.

00;11;17;28 - 00;11;20;16
Thurin
Yeah, I'm completely convinced of that. I mean, what could go wrong?

00;11;20;23 - 00;11;29;26
Mellie
I will not let you go by yourself. If you're going, like I will try to talk you out of it. But I think if you're, I can probably quickly tell that you're like no I’m going and I absolutely will not let you go by yourself.

00;11;30;02 - 00;11;32;20
Thurin
We’re adventures, of course everything will go perfectly fine.

00;11;33;08 - 00;11;33;27
Mellie
Okay, then I'm going with you.

00;11;34;04 - 00;11;34;27
Damos
So are we going?

00;11;35;18 - 00;11;45;14
Mellie
Well, there’s no deterrent. This is totally good. Look, I’ve got Bennies okay, bring it. Just kidding, don’t, okay?

00;11;46;12 - 00;11;50;25
Channel Master Nick
So are you going? How are you going to go about handling this at the moment?

00;11;50;25 - 00;12;03;19
Thurin
I'm I'm assuming that there is people or there's someone in trouble. So I am approaching cautiously and keeping an eye out, especially looking for things hiding behind the rocks.

00;12;03;19 - 00;12;24;25
Channel Master Nick
Go ahead and make another Notice roll. You don't really see anything out of the ordinary with the rocks themselves. You just see that there are several boar carcasses and it looks like they may have been dragged some because the blood just kind of spread out instead of pooled

00;12;25;15 - 00;12;43;06
Mellie
If we get, yeah, I'm going to go up a little bit closer, like here. I'm here. Can I can I get any more information of this scene? Like if they've been dragged, that indicates probably something very large had to of done this or human or something.

00;12;44;01 - 00;12;57;27
Channel Master Nick
Make a Survival check. All right. You were able to kind of make out impressions in the dried grass that look kind of like very large paws.

00;12;57;27 - 00;13;04;12
Mellie
Okay. So I will let you guys know. I think these are wolves, probably the wolves we heard.

00;13;04;23 - 00;13;06;25
Damos
You still think somebody needs help out?

00;13;06;25 - 00;13;10;00
Thurin
Obviously. Yeah, obviously someone needs help.

00;13;10;00 - 00;13;11;23
Mellie
And I'm going to draw. I don't I mean.

00;13;11;23 - 00;13;16;28
Thurin
These wolves must must have someone, you know, held captive or something in their lair.

00;13;16;28 - 00;13;18;09
Damos
But his bean said so.

00;13;18;09 - 00;13;24;27
Mellie
Now your god told you this? Is that talking through the beans? I’m so lost about how you communicate with him.

00;13;25;04 - 00;13;31;24
Thurin
Well, through through my through my globe. And I hold them up and I hold them close to my heart. It speaks to me.

00;13;31;26 - 00;13;36;15
Mellie
And he, and he said that the person that needs saving and then we find the person, that's what we do?

00;13;36;22 - 00;13;37;16
Damos
Is it going to be us?

00;13;37;18 - 00;13;42;18
Thurin
He said that someone is in need of our help. It's very, it's very mysterious and religious.

00;13;42;18 - 00;13;43;01
Mellie
Okay.

00;13;43;01 - 00;13;49;09
Thurin
I mean, six, six years of study really, really is it's this has brought me in tune with Gozreh.

00;13;49;18 - 00;13;57;09
Mellie
Yeah, a little above my head. That’s why I’m glad to have people like you. Otherwise I wouldn’t, I wouldn’t have any idea what the gods are saying.

00;13;57;17 - 00;14;00;19
Damos
And Nick, are the crows still going around overhead?

00;14;01;26 - 00;14;06;15
Channel Master Nick
They are. And currently they're not paying you any attention. They're busy feasting.

00;14;06;15 - 00;14;07;10
Damos
Okay.

00;14;07;10 - 00;14;10;12
Geldr
Well, I guess let's follow these paw prints.

00;14;10;12 - 00;14;13;20
Thurin
Can we tell which direction they're coming from? We're going to?

00;14;13;20 - 00;14;26;07
Channel Master Nick
It's hard to tell just from what you're able to see. If anyone wants to attempt to support her next Survival roll, you can roll Notice.

00;14;26;07 - 00;14;27;12
Damos
I'll support.

00;14;27;12 - 00;14;28;11
Channel Master Nick
To try to help her look.

00;14;29;17 - 00;14;34;13
Damos
So do I roll Notice or? Oh nevermind, he did.

00;14;34;28 - 00;14;37;04
Channel Master Nick
All right, so that's.

00;14;38;05 - 00;14;41;14
Mellie
So I actually got, I think a nine then with plus two.

00;14;42;04 - 00;14;55;00
Channel Master Nick
With Geldr looking out, now that you've pointed out footprints, go ahead and roll Survival again, and you'll get plus two. If anyone else wants to help, she can get up to a plus four.

00;14;55;15 - 00;14;56;11
Damos
I'll definitely help.

00;14;56;21 - 00;14;57;21
Mellie
Oh my god!

00;14;57;21 - 00;15;01;12
Thurin
Oh yeah, that that worked out perfectly for me.

00;15;02;03 - 00;15;10;08
Channel Master Nick
So, well let's see. So.

00;15;10;10 - 00;15;11;16
Damos
Oh wait, I haven't rolled. a Notice.

00;15;11;27 - 00;15;25;02
Channel Master Nick
Yeah. Geldr is tapping you on the shoulders. “I think they went this way. I think I see some paw prints.” and Thurin is like “No no Geldr says they’re that way.

00;15;25;02 - 00;15;26;01
Damos
Oh my God.

00;15;26;01 - 00;15;33;14
Channel Master Nick
And so you're not sure who to believe and then Damos just strolls up and is like “No they're going that way.”

00;15;33;14 - 00;15;46;25
Mellie
And I will admit that, because I'm believing through Thurin and Geldr, just like I don’t know who to believe, you’re telling me different things and you both talk to gods. I don’t know and it comes out super authoritatively. But I decide this is it, here we go!

00;15;47;25 - 00;15;53;19
Geldr
Okay I'm going to stop you right there. I don’t talk to gods, I talk to butterflies. All right? Let me be.

00;15;53;27 - 00;16;01;16
Mellie
So this is. Yes, it’s nature. now I get it. Now I see.

00;16;02;12 - 00;16;12;26
Channel Master Nick
So you can see that the ah, the tracks continue off in the general direction that you're heading. So are you actually getting that close Geldr?

00;16;12;26 - 00;16;15;29
Geldr
Yeah, I'm actually just strolling right up.

00;16;15;29 - 00;16;17;02
Channel Master Nick
You want to make a Stealth?

00;16;17;02 - 00;16;22;26
Geldr
I would love to make s Stealth. Thank you DM for asking. DM, I would love to use a Benny on that Stealth.

00;16;23;14 - 00;16;25;08
Channel Master Nick
I would love for you to use a Benny on that Stealth!

00;16;25;28 - 00;16;28;00
Mellie
You got it.

00;16;28;19 - 00;16;36;09
Channel Master Nick
All right. So what's going to happen is that’s going, that's going to be opposed by their Notice and you are slipping right through them.

00;16;36;09 - 00;16;41;29
Geldr
Yes! I am the night. Not really.

00;16;41;29 - 00;16;55;28
Channel Master Nick
You just quietly step through and make sure not to bump against any of the crows that were feasting and just kind of contorting yourself to avoid the ones overhead.

00;16;56;04 - 00;17;00;07
Mellie
Oh, oh, my. His god is so powerful.

00;17;00;11 - 00;17;04;18
Geldr
It's it's the guidance. It's the guidance of the butterflies, they're seeing me through.

00;17;04;18 - 00;17;10;13
Thurin
Well, should I assume you and crows don't get along?

00;17;10;13 - 00;17;22;23
Geldr
Who, me? Oh, no. I want to see your god guide you through. Come on, Thurin, come on. Come on. I'm motioning him like. Come on, you got this that I give him big thumbs up and I've got, like a huge, broad smile.

00;17;26;29 - 00;17;32;03
Channel Master Nick
So is Thurin going to accept this challenge?

00;17;32;03 - 00;17;35;05
Thurin
Sure.

00;17;35;05 - 00;17;41;12
Channel Master Nick
Okay. So with that, I would like for Geldr to make a Persuasion role to assist.

00;17;41;29 - 00;17;53;15
Damos
Oh, he's trying to support you. I see. Because you have bean and he doesn't. Makes sense, makes sense to me. I hope beans travel all the way through on this journey.

00;17;53;15 - 00;17;56;04
Geldr
Should I not be happy it's low?

00;17;56;04 - 00;17;59;26
Channel Master Nick
Well, it just means he doesn't get a bonus to his Stealth.

00;17;59;26 - 00;18;03;28
Geldr
Gotcha. I would have rather it have been high to be personally honest.

00;18;03;28 - 00;18;10;00
Channel Master Nick
So Thurin, go ahead and make your Stealth roll.

00;18;10;00 - 00;18;11;07
Damos
Oh,

00;18;11;07 - 00;18;19;18
Geldr
oh, oh, oh, oh. Well played sir! Well played.

00;18;19;18 - 00;18;34;12
Channel Master Nick
So Thurin is one with the crows as he gracefully makes his way through the dead boars across to the other side.

00;18;34;12 - 00;18;42;18
Geldr
So as Thurin gets over there, I'm like, All right, I know I've been giving you Hell, but I got to admit, that was beautiful.

00;18;42;18 - 00;18;47;16
Thurin
I owe it all to to Gozreh, who guides me.

00;18;47;16 - 00;18;50;11
Geldr
I'm sure you do. And I slap him on the back.

00;18;51;20 - 00;18;55;24
Damos
Oh, so since the other two are gone, what do we do?

00;18;56;04 - 00;19;07;11
Mellie
I'll go. I mean, I'll follow them. I, I think that they are looking for a person and I think with that roll I think that he is guided by his god. So I'm for sure going to try to go through.

00;19;07;22 - 00;19;07;27
Damos
Okay.

00;19;08;05 - 00;19;13;02
Mellie
No, I think I don't need to go through, I can just go around like.

00;19;13;02 - 00;19;14;20
Damos
Yeah, of course.

00;19;14;20 - 00;19;17;19
Mellie
I mean, you're the most amazing cleric I’ve probably ever interacted with.

00;19;17;19 - 00;19;20;24
Thurin
I'm also the only cleric you’ve ever interacted with.

00;19;20;24 - 00;19;22;28
Mellie
I mean, you know, I wasn't going to say that part.
