Hello and welcome to the Heroes of Lost Omens. Listen in as our heroes reunite in their hometown of Olfden and discuss their plans to seek out adventure.

00;00;10;29 - 00;00;19;25
Channel Master Nick
What was the reception like for each of you as you returned to town for the first time in so long? It doesn't have to be much. Just be a little something to add some flavor.

00;00;20;09 - 00;00;28;25
Thurin
My family was there to meet me. They had word that I was coming and held a big feast to celebrate when I graduated the seminary.

00;00;29;16 - 00;00;29;29
Channel Master Nick
Nice.

00;00;30;16 - 00;00;40;20
Damos
Upon returning back to town, I made sure to visit my parents gravesites and light some incense for them, leaving a prayer.

00;00;41;16 - 00;00;53;21
Mellie
I think that my parents were, of course, very happy to see me, but I had told people I was going to go find my fortune and I have come back without doing that. So I think I'm a little not ashamed because I don't really need to talk about what I’ve been doing the last six years.

00;00;54;03 - 00;01;02;16
Thurin
Mmhmm okay. You should just make something up like I did.

00;01;02;20 - 00;01;19;29
Geldr
So I was actually I was actually an orphan. But when I get into town, I have to talk my way out of a couple of owed old debts and telling them that I will pay them in good faith. Apart from that, I kind of just kind of skulk around.

00;01;20;29 - 00;01;47;29
Channel Master Nick
Okay. All right. So our story begins with this fated reunion between friends taking place within the Silver Bulette Inn. It's an expensive yet shabby place with watered down hill and passable bedding. Patrons of all types are here at this particular evening, from merchants to lumber workers and everyone in between. The patrons sit around many of the provided tables.

00;01;49;02 - 00;01;59;23
Channel Master Nick
With each of you sitting at one such table near the bar. And now I would like for you all to discuss the pact that you had made and what your plans for the future are at this point.

00;01;59;27 - 00;02;13;00
Mellie
Before we start talking about this grand adventure that I know we're all looking forward to, I'd like a toast, it's been six years and that’s a long time. And I'm you know, I hope that you all have had more fortuitous adventures than I've had. And I down my ale.

00;02;13;06 - 00;02;34;06
Damos
Oh, I agree. My journey has been full of enlightenment periods. And it's it's good to be around some familiar faces. So. Yes, I do look forward to this next chapter in my life and I try to drink the ale but can't seem to down all of it.

00;02;35;14 - 00;02;45;26
Geldr
I actually pass mine over to Melody and I said Sorry, I don't drink anymore, guys. Last time I did that, I robbed the wrong church. Yeah. Here's to the future.

00;02;47;00 - 00;03;08;23
Thurin
Yeah, I. As I say that I've learned a lot over the years about God and stuff and all the religious stuff that. Yeah, I just really want to, you know, put works that I've learned about, you know, God, stuff like that to do really good work.

00;03;08;29 - 00;03;13;15
Mellie
You seem very, very religious, very pious. Look at what you're wearing here.

00;03;13;21 - 00;03;23;25
Thurin
Oh, have you. Have you seen my Gazreh’s Globe? Look. Look, at the religious emblem that I carry. Isn't it beautiful? Shows how pious I am to Gozreh and all that stuff, you know?

00;03;24;05 - 00;03;26;29
Mellie
It is absolutely beautiful. Wow.

00;03;27;13 - 00;03;29;03
Damos
Why, yes, that does look fancy.

00;03;29;21 - 00;03;34;26
Geldr
So Geldr gives Thurin a pretty, pretty sharp look. And then winks at him.

00;03;35;10 - 00;03;38;02
Mellie
Oh, I have missed you all so much.

00;03;38;18 - 00;03;51;18
Thurin
Say, Well, you know, it normally wouldn't be the pious thing to do, but this one special occasion. I'll go ahead and have drink, share a drink, with you all. And I clink glasses and go ahead and down my ale.

00;03;51;19 - 00;03;52;29
Mellie
Yeah, things have really changed.

00;03;53;19 - 00;03;55;10
Thurin
My ears have grown at least and inch.

00;03;55;11 - 00;04;05;04
Mellie
And your nose. Six years really seemed like a long time when it was happening, but looking back, it feels like an age we've been together.

00;04;05;07 - 00;04;10;04
Geldr
Yeah, it's been too long since we've all been together now that we're here.

00;04;10;14 - 00;04;27;04
Mellie
Well, you know, we got that blood pact, you know, pricking our thumb many years ago, and I honestly didn't know if you would remember, but I'm thrilled. I'm so thrilled that you did. You know, I'm honestly ready to go find some gold.

00;04;27;04 - 00;04;37;06
Geldr
Oh, you guys are the only family I ever had. It was worth checking out. And what about you Damos? What have you been up to? You've been a little quiet.

00;04;37;06 - 00;04;57;08
Damos
My apologies, I've been trying to finish the ale. Well travel and just visiting other places. You know, communing with nature as such. But, yes, I have too missed all of you so very much. It's good to be back and well, more capable hands than my own.

00;04;58;13 - 00;05;24;05
Channel Master Nick
As you continue to discuss your plans for the future, you hear a gruff voice come from behind you. “What's this now? You lot looking for an adventure are you?” And you turn and you see a small and stout, ruddy faced man with an impressive beard, and two tankards of ale in each of his hands. His hair and his beard.

00;05;24;05 - 00;05;50;11
Channel Master Nick
are a very distinct copper color. And he apparently has been standing there listening to you for quite a bit. “I can help you with that, I can. Just talk to the barkeep and he can-”. And the dwarf pauses and takes another drink. Some of the ale spilling down his hand into his beard and on his tunic and he smacks his lips in appreciation before continuing.

00;05;51;18 - 00;06;07;22
Channel Master Nick
“He can tell you how to get to my lair. That'll be your first quest. And I'll have another for you once you get there.” And with that, the short man walks way back towards the table, nestled against a far corner where other men greet him gleefully.

00;06;10;18 - 00;06;15;24
Thurin
Turn to the group and I say, I say seems legit.

00;06;15;24 - 00;06;21;03
Geldr
Yeah. Did we just get offered?

00;06;21;03 - 00;06;25;11
Mellie
I have several questions. Yep, I'm sure this is totally on the up and up. Let's do it.

00;06;25;21 - 00;06;36;10
Channel Master Nick
Everyone make a Common Knowledge roll so you'll just double click on the die beside Common Knowledge.

00;06;36;10 - 00;06;39;23
Mellie
All right, nice.

00;06;40;14 - 00;07;17;17
Channel Master Nick
So, Geldr, you seem to remember rumors back when you were kids that there was a dragon that used to drink at the tap. But you've never seen a dragon at the tavern? And it sounded pretty ridiculous cause how would a dragon fit in a tavern? The rest of you also remember this rumor, but also remember that it was supposedly a copper dragon. And but again, you've never seen the dragon, so you just saw it was rumors and people making stuff up to keep you out of the tavern.

00;07;19;10 - 00;07;31;11
Channel Master Nick
And Thurin you're pretty sure this is legit from everything that you have heard, everything that you've seen and your studies. You think this might be a legit situation here.

00;07;32;06 - 00;07;45;00
Thurin
Listen, guys, I have done some extensive research and I believe wholeheartedly that this guy is on the up and up and he's going to point us in the right direction for a awesome adventure.

00;07;45;25 - 00;07;51;13
Mellie
You know? Okay, one hundred percent in and not going to question anything about this man further, you put my sword in direction that we’re going.

00;07;51;13 - 00;07;54;24
Damos
As long as I am in good company, I will follow it.

00;07;55;19 - 00;08;06;22
Thurin
Maybe we should go talk to the bartender and see if he has a directions on how to reach our red bearded friend is a red beard.

00;08;06;22 - 00;08;08;07
Channel Master Nick
Copper, copper, copper.

00;08;08;07 - 00;08;08;11
Mellie
Yeah.

00;08;09;06 - 00;08;13;03
Thurin
Yeah, that's what I said. Copper, bearded friend.

00;08;13;03 - 00;08;16;21
Mellie
Do we know the bartender was someone who would have been around here six years ago?

00;08;17;25 - 00;08;27;23
Channel Master Nick
You probably wouldn't have really known him. You've probably seen him here and there. But since you weren't really of drinking age at that time, you didn't really interact with him much.

00;08;28;23 - 00;08;35;16
Mellie
But he's been out of town. So if he vouches for this, this guy. Yeah, let's sidle up the bar.

00;08;36;05 - 00;08;37;13
Thurin
I bring the rest of my drink with me.

00;08;37;27 - 00;08;41;15
Mellie
And maybe I will bring the two that I have for refills.

00;08;41;15 - 00;08;51;18
Damos
I’m going to look at mine that I thought I finished but obviously did not and just kind of like clasp my hands together bow and just keep keep moving with the group. Leave it behind.

00;08;52;13 - 00;09;10;20
Geldr
I'm a I've got kind of a puzzled look still staring at the dude like I can't believe I've known a copper dragon this whole time. Melody Give me one of those drinks. As long as you're doing stupid things, I'm going back on the wagon.

00;09;10;20 - 00;09;14;02
Mellie
Yes, yeah, cheers! And I get us refills.

00;09;21;15 - 00;09;23;16
Geldr
Oh, Lord, this is going to be fun. Yeah.

00;09;23;18 - 00;09;41;18
Channel Master Nick
All right, so the guy at the bar, he's a bit sweaty. He's been kept pretty busy with the patrons tonight, and he's got a bald head, but a fancy beard. Well, fancy mustache I should say. He looks up to you and is like, “Hey, what can I do for you?”

00;09;41;28 - 00;09;46;01
Geldr
We would like directions to get to the Copper Dragon’s home. Thank you very much.

00;09;46;13 - 00;09;48;22
Thurin
Uh lair, thank you.

00;09;49;01 - 00;09;53;16
Geldr
Home, lair, what's the difference? It's a copper dragon, they're supposed to be good. They just talk your ear off, right? Right.

00;09;54;06 - 00;09;58;00
Channel Master Nick
“Oh, you've actually been speaking with Wataxshyl have you?”

00;09;58;00 - 00;09;58;07
Mellie
Right.

00;09;58;09 - 00;10;05;15
Channel Master Nick
“Oh, really? That’s highly unusual but very interesting.”

00;10;05;15 - 00;10;07;15
Mellie
I mean he knows quality when he see it I guess.

00;10;07;15 - 00;10;34;28
Channel Master Nick
“I guess so. He is a good sort he alone pretty much keeps us in business. Granted, he drinks us out of the place most of the time, but he seems to enjoy it here so we don't complain. As long as he's got the gold. He's done a lot for this town in the past, so we abide by his drunkenness here and there as long as he doesn't, you know, go full dragon on us.”

00;10;34;28 - 00;10;37;12
Mellie
Has he, has he ever done that? Has he ever gone full dragon in here?

00;10;37;12 - 00;10;41;08
Channel Master Nick
“Oh, no. The worst he's done is broken half the tables.”

00;10;41;08 - 00;10;42;03
Mellie
Oh he hasn’t at all.

00;10;42;26 - 00;10;45;07
Thurin
Yeah you never go full dragon.

00;10;45;07 - 00;10;46;13
Channel Master Nick
“He paid for it afterwards.”

00;10;46;13 - 00;10;55;05
Geldr
Do you remember exactly what it was that caused him to go full dragon? I want to see this. I need to make this happen. What was the specific cause? I need step by step instructions.

00;10;55;07 - 00;10;55;25
Mellie
Details.

00;10;56;00 - 00;10;58;09
Damos
He needs to remain calm.

00;10;58;17 - 00;11;07;02
Channel Master Nick
“Lots and lots of alcohol. It was a particularly rowdy, night.”

00;11;07;15 - 00;11;08;09
Thurin
Noted! Give me four

00;11;08;09 - 00;11;08;23
Geldr
rounds.

00;11;09;02 - 00;11;14;26
Channel Master Nick
“Oh, no, we've learned to limit him. He doesn't like it. But he accepts it.”

00;11;15;15 - 00;11;24;21
Geldr
Can. Sorry, I was just going to ask the GM. Can Geldr make a quick perception check just to see if he sees where any like really, really good booze are?

00;11;25;23 - 00;11;43;18
Channel Master Nick
Yeah, you can go ahead and make a Notice roll. All right. With that roll, you can kind of see on the bottom shelf behind most of the liquor that's there, you can see a bottle that looks a little fancier tucked away behind the normal stuff.

00;11;44;12 - 00;11;50;14
Geldr
I know. You know, I know. You know what I'm about to do. So would you let me roll Stealth or Thievery first?

00;11;50;28 - 00;11;51;25
Thurin
Yeah. What could go wrong?

00;11;52;10 - 00;11;53;13
Channel Master Nick
That of Persuasion.

00;11;53;13 - 00;11;55;04
Geldr
No, I'm going to. I'm going to go to the back route.

00;11;56;16 - 00;11;56;25
Damos
Oh.

00;11;57;24 - 00;12;15;22
Channel Master Nick
You would need to do a really good Stealth, followed by a really good Thievery, because he's standing right in front of the stuff. That's a so-so, he kind of eyes you as you start walking towards the open ended the bar. Now he just eyes you're a little warily.

00;12;16;08 - 00;12;18;05
Geldr
Okay.

00;12;18;05 - 00;12;19;21
Damos
Can I ask him for some water?

00;12;20;10 - 00;12;36;24
Channel Master Nick
“Oh, certainly.” And he reaches down and he slides the bottles of alcohol away that are right next to that fancy bottle. And he pulls it out. And for a glass of water.

00;12;36;24 - 00;12;37;27
Damos
Oh, thank you. kind sir.

00;12;39;04 - 00;12;40;14
Mellie
Wow. Is that magic water?

00;12;41;09 - 00;13;00;07
Channel Master Nick
“Oh, no, it's just regular water. I just had this fancy bottle that got emptied out by Wataxshyl a long time ago and I decided to keep it because I like the way it looks. Now we just put water in there for just such an occasion.”

00;13;00;07 - 00;13;02;26
Damos
Well I appreciate the occasion. Thank you, sir.

00;13;02;27 - 00;13;29;24
Channel Master Nick
“Oh, of course. Now, since you're asking about Wataxshyl’s lair, it's roughly a full day's ride northeast of here. Uh, I tell you what, since he's taken such an interest in you, you go upstairs, find you a couple rooms. Rest tonight. Have a fresh start in the morning. I'll get some horses ready for you and I'll put it all on his tab.”

00;13;30;08 - 00;13;30;23
Thurin
Awesome.

00;13;31;02 - 00;13;32;19
Mellie
Yeah. I don't think we can say no to that.

00;13;32;27 - 00;13;48;14
Channel Master Nick
“This is a rare occasion. Like I said, usually he just comes here to drink. He doesn't really interact with people that much other than to make jolly in the tavern. so well. I'm interested in seeing where this goes.”

00;13;49;02 - 00;13;57;07
Mellie
Well me to now. So I want to believe that we're all special, but I'm a little bit worried that we are getting set up here. But I'm sure it's fine. I'm sure it's totally fine.

00;13;57;15 - 00;14;08;03
Thurin
It's totally fine. Believe me. Every bit of my research told me it’s, it's fine. As a matter of fact, can we give it another round on his tab for the group to celebrate the occasion?

00;14;09;05 - 00;14;34;00
Channel Master Nick
Garvin kind of looks up and peers over at Wataxshyl table and sees the little dwarf having a good time with his people and just laughing and stuff and he's like, “Oh, why not? He'll never ask what his tab is anyways.” And he slides you all a new drink.

00;14;34;00 - 00;14;35;25
Mellie
Absolutely, going to sleep real good tonight.

00;14;36;24 - 00;14;40;28
Damos
I'm going to just be like, I'm good with just water. Thanks.

00;14;42;05 - 00;14;45;11
Thurin
I'll take his. It's a special occasion. Yeah.

00;14;46;08 - 00;14;46;29
Mellie
We can't waste it.

00;14;47;09 - 00;14;49;04
Thurin
It's basically really a religious holiday.

00;14;49;10 - 00;14;52;16
Mellie
This assortment. Yes, I like this. I agree.

00;14;52;16 - 00;14;56;27
Damos
Oh, of course. Yes, but by all means, please have it. All right.

00;14;57;20 - 00;15;20;22
Channel Master Nick
So after your festivities, you're able to find a couple of empty rooms, sleep up for the night, some of the best sleep you've had since you've been away. And you wake up early the next day to the smell of very delicious breakfast foods. It smells like anything that you can imagine as being cooked.

00;15;21;00 - 00;15;27;05
Thurin
I wake up and I'm like, Oh my God, that smells so much better than anything that they ever served in the seminary.

00;15;28;19 - 00;15;38;25
Mellie
I, if I’m smelled bacon then I’m all for that. I’m downstairs basically as soon I can roll out of bed, trying to get a plate of that bacon and potatoes.

00;15;39;07 - 00;15;39;21
Thurin
Same here.

00;15;39;28 - 00;15;40;21
Channel Master Nick
Everyone else heading down?

00;15;41;12 - 00;15;43;21
Thurin
Yup heading downstairs for breakfast.

00;15;44;14 - 00;15;49;06
Damos
I was up early that morning meditating, but yes, I will head down.

00;15;49;06 - 00;15;49;17
Channel Master Nick
All right.

00;15;50;07 - 00;15;51;29
Geldr
Is there a mirror in the room?

00;15;52;10 - 00;15;53;24
Channel Master Nick
Oh, yeah. So there's a mirror.

00;15;54;04 - 00;16;02;10
Geldr
Okay, I. I mean, I'm just going to check the mirror right quick, and if nothing happens, then I'll go down.

00;16;03;25 - 00;16;05;03
Channel Master Nick
What are you expecting to happen?

00;16;06;21 - 00;16;08;10
Geldr
You know exactly what I'm expecting to happen.

00;16;08;29 - 00;16;10;25
Channel Master Nick
I don't know if we can talk about that on a recording.

00;16;12;00 - 00;16;15;02
Geldr
I don't think we can. Secrets to the Universe.

00;16;15;08 - 00;16;23;28
Damos
Mirror, mirror on the wall. Who's the fairest one of them all? While he's staring at himself. I guess we're eating breakfast.

00;16;24;26 - 00;16;25;07
Mellie
Yeah.

00;16;25;16 - 00;16;42;15
Channel Master Nick
Yeah. Cool. All right. So, yeah, there's piles of various meats and eggs and vegetables all over the place. Ready for you. And Garvin also informs you that there are horses hitched outside waiting for you.

00;16;42;25 - 00;16;45;27
Damos
After I finish my salad, I'll be ready to go.

00;16;46;11 - 00;16;52;14
Mellie
I'm absolutely loading up like knowing that this might be the last good meal in a while eat until I’m very full.

00;16;53;01 - 00;16;58;09
Channel Master Nick
And he also hands you a compass, that way you won't get lost. Who wants the compass?

00;16;58;16 - 00;16;59;08
Damos
Who gets the compass?

00;16;59;08 - 00;17;00;20
Mellie
Who wants the compass?

00;17;01;24 - 00;17;03;16
Thurin
The compass uses what attributes?

00;17;04;05 - 00;17;07;02
Channel Master Nick
Probably just a Smarts roll.

00;17;07;11 - 00;17;08;12
Damos
I can use the compass.

00;17;09;14 - 00;17;16;15
Channel Master Nick
All right. I'm going to reward every one with a Benny for their participation so far.

00;17;16;15 - 00;17;17;15
Mellie
Yay!

00;17;18;03 - 00;17;18;07
Channel Master Nick


00;17;18;08 - 00;17;20;22
Thurin
Did Geldr ever come down and eat with us?

00;17;21;12 - 00;17;23;09
Damos
You probably came at the tail end of it.

00;17;23;09 - 00;17;29;16
Geldr
Yeah, I came down and grab like, a piece of bacon on my way out.
